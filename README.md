Resume of snowballing

Step 1 - Studies' Selection:
The Forward process it was applied in the studies of Table~\ref{tab:studies_seminais} and the Backward process was applied in the studies found in the previous step.
The following selection criteria have been applied to the Forward and Backward processes:
Inclusion 1 - Studies that present the treatment of the infeasible path problem during the structural test activity.
Exclusion 1 - Studies not available in full.
Exclusion 2 - Studies not available in English or Portuguese. %(because it is the native language of the authors of seminal studies).

Step 2 - Data Extraction:
After the complete read of the select studies, we extracted the data: Title, Author, Journal or Conference published, Context, Causes, Objectives, Algorithm or Method Used, Heuristic (if any), Restrictions used (if any) and Assessment Methods (if any).
Step 3 - Data Classification:
The selected papers in Step 2 were organized by: publication period, approaches. In the context of this paper, an approach is any methodology developed to deal with infeasible requirements. Through this information we answer the research questions.

RQ1:What approaches support addressing the infeasible problem?
RQ2: What infeasible requirements identification properties are highlighted?
